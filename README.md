# Body_Performance_App

In physical therapy/personal training, trainers need a way to have an initial test on their clients to mesure body performance, which can later be used to measure progress in the future. 

In this project, I am using Python to create test multiple models simotaniously using bayesian optimization. I am using the optimal model to deploy the model into a Streamlit web app that can be used for interactive predictions.
